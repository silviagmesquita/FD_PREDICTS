## Title
##some R

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
FD <- read.csv("Functional_Diversity.csv")
str(FD)
```


Looking at the structure of FD
Now we make a graph of the FD against the change in FD

```{r}
ggplot(FD, aes(x = S2LandUse, y = DeltaFD, colour = Use_intensity)) +
         geom_boxplot()
```


























## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
